## Which screen sizes was this tested on?

I tried to test it in the most common screen sizes, so it should work on:

|   width   |  height   |
|-----------|-----------|
|   1920    |   1080    |
|   1536    |    864    |
|   1366    |    768    |
|   1280    |    720    |
|   1024    |    600    |
|    600    |    800    |
|    412    |    915    |
|    393    |    873    |
|    360    |    800    |
|    360    |    780    |
|    360    |    640    |


## What's to come?

If time is on my side... a lot! 
- A node backend, so real users can be created, and the custom movies can be stored in a DB.
- Save to favorites, clicking on a heart icon, and of course, also removing them!
- Languages! i18n seems to be trickier on nextJS than it is on React.
- Infinite click on thumbnails: for now it works only for the main screens, but it should work for the recommended series and movies too!
- More animations!
- Series episodes separated by seasons.
- User profiles.
- Testing! oh god, so much to test, so little time.
- Screenshots.
